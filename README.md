# Defenders Beat by Pass Statistic for 2022 World Cup Data

## Project Description

This project uses StatBomb's open-source data and API to develop a statistic that quantifies how many defenders are bypassed by a player's successful forward pass, focusing on the 2022 World Cup. This new metric, combined with other passing statistics, offers insights into the most effective and efficient passers in the tournament. This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook with the analysis, a PDF of the project report, and a PDF version of the project presentation.
